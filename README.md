# LongCatDemo

#Long Cat Building Management is part of the solution to Sustainable Development Goal 11, the mission to "Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable".
#Our app aims to lower energy consumption in populated residential areas.

#Compact residential communities can cause great harm to nature when not under observation.
#We wanted to prevent unnecessary energy consumption by these buildings and still maintain a clean environment.

#Long Cat Building Monitor is designed to combat unnecessary energy consumption and keep communities safe by keeping a track of the most recent data from buildings.
#With the data on hand, our app can warn the user to contact the residential building.
